What's New in 4.2
-----------------
This release fully supports all MongoDB releases from versions 2.6 to 4.4. 
New features of the 4.2 Java driver release include:
- The Reactive Streams driver now utilizes `Project Reactor <https://projectreactor.io/>`_ internally. 
Project reactor follows the Reactive Streams specification and has greatly simplified the implementation of the driver.

Added support for:
- Azure and GCP key stores to client-side field level encryption
- caching Kerberos tickets so that they can be re-used for multiple authentication requests
- constructing legacy com.mongodb.MongoClient instances with MongoClientSettings or ConnectionString as the configuration, instead of MongoClientOptions or MongoClientURI
- explain of find and aggregate commands
- the BsonIgnore annotation in Scala case classes

Added a:
- JsonObject class to make encoding from and decoding to JSON more efficient by avoiding an intermediate Map representation
- BsonRepresentation annotation that allows ObjectId BSON values to be represented as Strings in POJO classes
- ``Filters.empty()`` method

What's New in 4.1
-----------------
This release fully supports all MongoDB releases from versions 2.6 to 4.4. New features of the 4.1 Java driver release include:
- Significant reduction in client-perceived failover times during planned maintenance events
- Update and delete operations support index hinting
- The find operation supports ``allowDiskUse`` for sorts that require too much memory to execute in RAM.
- Authentication supports the MONGODB-AWS mechanism using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.
- Authentication requires fewer round trips to the server, resulting in faster connection setup.

What's New in 4.0
