.. _version-4.2:

What's New in 4.2
-----------------
New features of the 4.2 Java driver release include:

- Enabled Azure and GCP key stores to client-side field level encryption
- Enabled Kerberos caching tickets for reuse in multiple authentication requests
- `com.mongodb.MongoClient <http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/MongoClients.html>`_ instances with ``MongoClientSettings`` or ``ConnectionString`` as the configuration
-  ``explain`` can now be used on `find <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/FindIterable.html#explain()>`_ and `aggregate <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-sync/com/mongodb/client/AggregateIterable.html#explain()>`_ commands
- Added `JsonObject <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/bson/org/bson/json/JsonObject.html#%3Cinit%3E(java.lang.String)>`_ class to make encoding from and decoding to JSON more efficient by avoiding an intermediate Map representation
- Added `BsonRepresentation <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/bson/org/bson/codecs/pojo/annotations/BsonRepresentation.html>`_ annotation that allows ``ObjectId`` BSON values to be represented as a ``String`` in `POJO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object>`_ classes
- Added `Filters.empty() <https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/4.2/apidocs/mongodb-driver-core/com/mongodb/client/model/Filters.html#empty()>`_ method
