The releases starting at 4.1 fully support all MongoDB releases from versions 2.6 to 4.4.

What's New in 4.2
-----------------
New features of the 4.2 Java driver release include:

- The Reactive Streams driver utilizes `Project Reactor <https://projectreactor.io/>`_ internally. Project Reactor follows the `Reactive Streams <https://www.reactive-streams.org/>`_ specification and has simplified the implementation of the driver.

Support for:
++++++++++++

- Azure and GCP key stores to client-side field level encryption
- caching Kerberos tickets so that they can be re-used for multiple authentication requests
- constructing legacy ``com.mongodb.MongoClient`` instances with ``MongoClientSettings`` or ``ConnectionString`` as the configuration, instead of ``MongoClientOptions`` or ``MongoClientURI``
- ``explain`` of ``find`` and ``aggregate`` commands
- the ``BsonIgnore`` annotation in Scala case classes

Added a:
++++++++

- ``JsonObject`` class to make encoding from and decoding to JSON more efficient by avoiding an intermediate Map representation
- ``BsonRepresentation`` annotation that allows ``ObjectId`` BSON values to be represented as a ``String`` in `POJO <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object>`_ classes
- ``Filters.empty()`` method

What's New in 4.1
-----------------
New features of the 4.1 Java driver release include:

- Significant reduction in client-perceived failover times during planned maintenance events
- ``update`` and ``delete`` support index hinting
- ``find`` supports ``allowDiskUse`` for sorts that require too much memory to execute in RAM
- Authentication supports the MONGODB-AWS mechanism using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials.
- Authentication requires fewer round trips to the server, resulting in faster connection setup.

What's New in 4.0
